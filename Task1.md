Task 1:

Inputs

- num1 = int(input("Enter the first number:"))  
  Prompts the user, reads a line of text, and converts it from string to integer before storing it in num1.
- num2 = int(input("Enter the second number:"))  
  Does the same for the second value and stores it in num2.

Operations

Each print statement labels the operation and evaluates an expression using the two integers:

- print("Addition:", num1+num2) uses the + operator to add the numbers.
- print("Subraction:", num1-num2) uses - to subtract num2 from num1.
- print("Multipliction:", num1*num2) uses * to multiply them.
- print("Division:", num1/num2) uses / for floating-point division of num1 by num2.
